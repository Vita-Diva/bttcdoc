# Welcome to BitTorrent-Chain

Welcome to the BitTorrent-Chain (hereafter referred to as BTTC) world. We are a ground-breaking blockchain platform.

BTTC is an extension of the public blockchain. It's a proof-of-stake (PoS) chain that supports Ethereum's existing features while also being speedier and with cheaper transaction fees.

## dApp Development

You are already a BTTC developer if you have developed a dApp on TRON or Ethereum. On BTTC, you can use familiar development tools like Truffle, Remix, and others. You can begin using BTTC's RPC by switching to it.

```js
const Web3 = require('Web3')

const web3 = new Web3('TBD:BTTC RPC')
```

You can deploy your smart contract on BTTC without worrying about the underlying architecture if you have a ready-made dApp that is compatible with EVM.
